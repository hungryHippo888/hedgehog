          The startup our group chose, <span style="text-decoration: underline; text-shadow: 1px 1px 4px #BFA68B;">Hedgehog,</span> is designing <span style="text-decoration: underline; text-shadow: 1px 1px 4px #BFA68B;">AI-driven robots to optimize the mushroom farming process</span>. Even though parts of the process will be automated, there will still be a need for overview and intervention from experienced mushroom farmers, and the mobile app we have designed is intended for those users to be able to overview the status of the farm, plan out planting and harvesting dates, and interact with the robotics. We hope this app has a positive impact on the workstyles of the users, making their farming work more efficient and less tedious by delegating away automatable tasks, while also letting them work professionally with an app that is intuitive to learn and use daily.

                    <p>We thought of many different ways to represent the analytics dashboard of all the different clusters in the app, and in the end we chose a spatial representation in the form of a simplified map of the farm. This page acts as the landing page for the app because it functions as the highest level overview of the mushroom farm. It allows the user to see the status of the farm, including any issues with planted mushroom clusters (these issues are marked with a warning icon, implying there needs to be human interaction with an un-automatable task). From this page, the user can also click on empty cluster spaces to show that they will plant a new cluster, or see more information about an already planted cluster by clicking on its box and seeing the details & analytics page.</p>

                    <p>We decided to create an “Add New Cluster” page to showcase the user adding a new cluster that the robot can interact with. The necessary fields we had were Nickname, Cluster Number, Date Planted, and Mushroom Type. The Nickname, Cluster Number, and Mushroom Type fields allow the user to identify specific clusters, and the Date Planted field records when the user planted a particular cluster of mushrooms.</p>

The temperature and humidity information comes from the robot’s sensors and are provided to the user to help with any warnings/changes they may need to make. These pages can be accessed by clicking on any mushroom cluster from the home/map page, or by clicking on a cluster’s name from the calendar page.</p>

                    <p>We decided to build an Apple-inspired calendar page for the user to keep track of dates for planting and harvesting mushroom clusters. We thought that having all of the information on the initial month-calendar page would be overwhelming, so we adopted Apple’s use of dots below the date to signify an event (planting or harvesting) on that day.</p>
